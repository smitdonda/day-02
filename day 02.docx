(1)	 List 5 difference between Browser JS(console) v Nodejs ?

a)	Browser js(console):

•	“window” is a predefined global object which has functions and attributes, that have to deal with window that has been drawn.
•	“location” is another predefined object in browsers, that has all the information about the url we have loaded.
•	“document”, which is also another predefined global variable in browsers, has the html which is rendered.
•	Browsers may have an object named “global”, but it will be the exact one as “window”.
•	Browsers don’t have “require” predefined. You may include it in your app for asynchronous file loading.
•	Moduling is not mandatory in client side JavaScript, i.e. in browsers

b)	Nodejs: 
•	Node doesn’t have a predefined “window” object cause it doesn’t have a window to draw anything.
•	“location” object is related to a particular url; that means it is for page specific. So, node doesn’t require that.
•	Ofcourse Node doesn’t have “document” object also, cause it never have to render anything in a page.
•	Node has “global”, which is a predefined global object. It contains several functions that are not available in browsers, cause they are needed for server side works only.
•	“require” object is predefined in Node which is used to include modules in the app.
